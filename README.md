# UQLoft

## Initial ideas
- Homepage - basic search box to search for a course (with autofill)
- Each course has its own page - pull description and info for course, have a link to ECP, list of papers
- Reject invalid search queries (incorrect course code)
- Main focus is on multiple choice questions for now (going to use CSSE1001 because the tests are all multiple choice)

- Each test page will have a view paper option (pdf viewer), view answers/discussion
- Each question is collapsable

## Tech stack
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)

## Linking the database to the git-repository
Some of these resources will also be useful with regards to uploading/editing data in the database. 
- download SSMS (SQL Server management studio) https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15
