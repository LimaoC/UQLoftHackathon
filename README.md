Crowd-sourced solutions for all your exam papers!

## Initial ideation
### Feature ideas
- Homepage - search for courses (autofill)
- Each course has its own page - pull description and info for course, have a link to ECP, list of papers
- Reject invalid search queries (incorrect course code)
- Main focus is on multiple choice questions for now (going to use CSSE1001 because the tests are all multiple choice)
- Each test page will have a view paper option (pdf viewer), view answers/discussion
- Each question is collapsable -- potentially could use pop-up modals?
### Name ideas
- [Attic synonyms on google](https://www.google.com/search?q=attic+synonym)
- UQ Sky Parlour (we're going to use this name for the live chat feature)
- UQ Loft
- UQ Gambrel

## Tech stack
### Version Control and Deployment
- [Github](https://github.com)
### Front-end Web Design
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
### Back-end Data Management
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
- [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)
- [SQL (attempted)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)
### Hosting
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Heroku](https://heroku.com/)

## Hindsight 2020
- Maybe don’t use React and Flask if you don’t know what you’re doing with either of them
- Maybe watch YouTube tutorials BEFORE the hackathon starts
- Don’t attempt to use INFS1200 knowledge – APIs all the way
- Not enough whiteboards
### But we learnt...
- Some knowledge of version control on GitHub
- Greater depth of knowledge in APIs and requests
