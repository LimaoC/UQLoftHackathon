# UQLoft

## Initial ideas
- Homepage - basic search box to search for a course (with autofill)
- Each course has its own page - pull description and info for course, have a link to ECP, list of papers
- Reject invalid search queries (incorrect course code)
- Main focus is on multiple choice questions for now (going to use CSSE1001 because the tests are all multiple choice)

- Each test page will have a view paper option (pdf viewer), view answers/discussion
- Each question is collapsable
